# Story-Time

This project was assigned by __Dr. Matthew Lang__. 
Dr. Lang provided a framework and coded the _treasure_ and _TextAdventure_ class.

This project is a text adventure game. I coded a new game world in _MyAdventure_. The project focused on coding complex programs considely and the implementation of simple classes of objects.  

It requires _stdlib.jar_ which was provided by Dr. Lang.
